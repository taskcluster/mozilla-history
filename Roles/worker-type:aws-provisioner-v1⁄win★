  "description": "queue:create-artifact:* is needed by generic worker (perhaps because it uses, or used, the worker credentials to upload artifacts??)\n\nWindows workerTypes have `aws-provisioner:view-worker-type` to allow generic worker to access its own config, if its worker type is updated. It queries the provisioner to get the latest worker type definition, to establish if a new deployment is required, by checking the deploymentId field, and seeing if that is different to its current deploymentId. If it is, it will shut down.\n",
