  "description": "This role was auto-generated by pmoore on 28 October 2016 to allow generic worker to access its own config, if its worker type is updated. It queries the provisioner to get the latest worker type definition, to establish if a new deployment is required, by checking the deploymentId field, and seeing if that is different to its current deploymentId. If it is, it will shut down.",
