  "description": "Read/write access to worker type secrets for servo workers.\n\nAWS workers gain read access to their worker type secret automatically since the credentials provided by the aws-provisioner to the worker have scope `assume:worker-type:aws-provisioner-v1/\u003cworkerType\u003e` which expands to include the secrets scope from [role `worker-type:*`](https://tools.taskcluster.net/auth/roles/worker-type%3A*).\n\nThis role serves to grant not only read but also write access to the worker type secrets, which is useful for e.g. servo worker admins.\n\nAccess requested in [bug 1375182](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1375182#c8) and granted by pmoore on 13 Feb 2019.",
